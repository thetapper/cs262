# ReadMe

a. We’ve used ReactNative context to store app state. Name one other alternative and explain whether it would be better to stay with context or to switch.
Right now the ReacNative context works well for our project and it is very simple with just a list and a delete function. But if we needed more components and more functionality a good option would be Redux.

b.When does the app actually load the item data?
The app is actually loaded during the _layout.tsx processing.

c.What ReactNative hook is used for this?
The useEffect hook.

d.How effectively did Copilot work for you on this assignment? Include examples of things that it did correctly and/or incorrectly.
It worked alright, the bigest problem that copilot has while writting code is an overabundance of work. Meaning it give more than is actually needed. And more specifically it has a lot of troulbe connecting files when makig calls. However it does a wonderful job of writting simple functions!
