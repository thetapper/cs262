# Readme lab05

- Why couldn’t the original app, as implemented before you made the changes in this exercise, delete any items from the list? The _layout was not wrapped in the <ItemProvider> which then made the functions unavalliabe.

- What would you do to update this app to allow users to add a new item and to update an existing item? Just explain what you’d do, without giving any code. I would start by building the function in ItemContext and then implementing it throughout app/.

- Did the old implementation follow the best practices for URL parameters? Does the new version? Passing the URL through with JSON is not following the best practices with the updated version makes it cleaner and of the better practice.

- The deleteItem is wrapped by useCallback. What good does this do? This simply establishs the rendering process of deleteItem improving preformance.

- Can what you’ve done in this exercise be seen as refactoring the original app? Yes, since the app now has access to the functions such as the delete function it can be considered refactoring.
