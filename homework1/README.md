# Homework 1

- Object
 const styles = StyleSheet.create({

- Anonymous Function using arrow function

 const addOrEditTodo = () => {
    if (newTodo.trim()) {

- Asynchronous Programming

  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginBottom: 20,
    textAlign: 'center',
  },

- Modules

 My entire file of index.tsx is a module.

- TypeScript-Specific Code

 const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([]);

- CSS-like Specification

 const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#fff',
  },

- reflection:
    Over all I think working with Copilet was very effective. It likes to import and add more than neccessary which complicates the code. It also knows that there are other tabs with possible code inside but it thinks that all of the code for the program has to be crammed into one, which is just one example of little problems that it has.
